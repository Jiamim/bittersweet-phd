# Bittersweet PhD
We are a group of PhD students with computational background. 

This is a project which collects potentially useful technical tips we wish to know earlier in our phd life (latex, python/R visualization, etc.).

This may include some secret recipes handed down from our academic 'ancestors', or some magical tricks we figured out ourselves after looking through tons of stackoverflow questions.

**This project is currently under construction.**
